for add resize ligthmap function - need add function for resize BSP map - make re-save each lump. 
lump 35 or "Game lump" contain offsets to raw data relative begining of BSP file.
If need resize BSP -> need shift lumps -> need recalculate offsets to raw data in lump 35.
 ### Also need share source code if exists other lumps that hame same problem as lump 35. - checked, only lump 35 have this problem.
